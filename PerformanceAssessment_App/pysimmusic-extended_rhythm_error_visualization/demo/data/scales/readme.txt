######## GUIDELINES FOR CHORD-SCALE EXERCISE CREATION USING MUSESCORE ################

STEP 1 : Create a new file in Jazz Lead Sheet format. Title ex: 'Chord-Scale Exercise'.
METER : 4/4
NUMBER OF MEASURES : 24 (can be modified according to exercise design)
TEMPO (BPM) : 100

STEP 2 : In the blank sheet, first divide separate sections by putting 'Double Barline' (from Barlines) at the end of each section (or each chord-scale type to estimate/evaluate)

STEP 3 : Add 'Staff Text' (from Texts) to the first note of each section. In the text line, write the type of chord-scale to be played using following format: 'E ionian'  - !upper/lower case sensitive

NOTE : The type of chord-scales included in this analysis can be found in 'scales_utilities.py', under 'ScaleDictionary' function.

-- OPTIONAL --

STEP 4 : You can add key signatures to the first note at each section for more instructive notation. 

STEP 5 : Also you can add chords to measure/notes (CTRL + K, while note is selected) to provide harmonic content of the backing track.

-- END OF OPTIONAL STEPS --

STEP 6 : File --> Export --> Choose MusicXML (*.xml) file type --> Press OK.

You can use this XML file for the annotations of the Chord-Scales Exercise
